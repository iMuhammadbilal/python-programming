# Introduction to Python

#Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

#Python is one of the world's easiest and most popular programming languages. This course will teach you the basics of Python, without requiring any prior knowledge.

#In Python, we use print() to show words on the screen. The words go inside quotation marks.

print("Hello, World!")  # Output: Hello, World!


# Note that anything inside quotation marks is case sensitive. For example:

print("hello, world!")  # Output: hello, world!


# ----  What Is “Code”?

# Code is a set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute. In Python, code is written in a human-readable format, which makes it easier to learn and use.

# Code is just a series of instructions for a computer to follow one after another. Programs can have a lot of instructions.


# Code runs in order, starting at the top of the program. For example:

print("this prints first")
print("this prints second")
print("this prints last")
