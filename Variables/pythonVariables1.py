# what is variable in python

# A variable in Python is a reserved memory location to store values.
# Variables are created when you assign a value to them. They can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, lists, and more.

# Variables are how we store data as our program runs.
# We can create a variable by assigning a value to it.


#In short a variable is like a memory unit that we can access by typing the name of the variable. 

#Each variable has a unique name and a value that can be of different types.


#creating a variable

#A "variable" is just a name that we give to a value. For example, we can make a new variable named my_name and set its value to "Bilal":

my_name = "Bilal"


# We have the freedom to choose any name for our variables, but they should be descriptive and consist of a single "token", meaning continuous text with underscores separating the words.

# USING VARIABLES


# Once we have a variable, we can access its value by using its name. For example, this will print

print(my_name)


# Assigement about variables?
# Let's create a variable to store our age and print it:
my_age = 25
print(my_age)
